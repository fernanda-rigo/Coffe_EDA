# Exploratory data analysis within coffee production, rural population, and trades

### Python practicing

## DATA 

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)

### Coffe production (tonnes) by country and region: 

Dataset: Crops and livestock products
Crop and livestock statistics are recorded for 278 products. Last Updated February 17, 2022

### Annual population (rural population included)

The FAOSTAT Population module contains time series data on population, by sex and urban/rural. The series consist of both estimates and projections for different periods as available from the original sources, namely: 1. Population data refers to the World Population Prospects: The 2019 Revision from the UN Population Division.
2. Urban/rural population data refers to the World Urbanization Prospects: The 2018 Revision from the UN Population Division. Last updated in December 3, 2021

### Trade
DATA

## Part I - Coffe Production, and rural production
### OKR - Objective 1: 
1. KR1 = Who are the largests coffee producers ever?
Using python pandas:

### Top20 Coffe producers of all time.
['Brazil', 'Colombia', 'Viet Nam', 'Indonesia', 'Mexico', 'Guatemala', 'India', 'Uganda', 'Peru', 'Honduras', 'Ethiopia', 'El Salvador', 'Costa Rica', 'Ethiopia PDR', 'Philippines', 'Cameroon', 'Ecuador', 'Madagascar', 'Kenya', 'Democratic Republic of the Congo']

### Top10 Coffe producers of all time.
['Brazil', 'Colombia', 'Viet Nam', 'Indonesia', 'Mexico', 'Guatemala', 'India', 'Uganda', 'Peru', 'Honduras']

2. KR2 = How the coffee productions oscilates during years (1961 to 2018)in the top10 countries?

Applying pandas as pd, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and seaborn as sns, I plotted the data as seen below.
After the 90', attention is drawn to four countries: Brazil, Viet Nam, Indonesia, and Colombia.


3. KR3 = Is there any relation between rural proportions of total population and coffe_production? 




## Part II - Coffe Production and trade
### OKR
Objective 1
KR1 =
KR2 = Who are the biggest coffe importers? 
KR4 = What type of coffe is most imported?.
KR3 =

KR1 = Is the production of coffee related to rural population in each country?
